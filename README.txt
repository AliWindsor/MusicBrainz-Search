Artist Search Using MusicBrainz API

This is an application built using MusicBrainz API.

Features:
    •    User to types a keyword into the search bar.
    •    API returns a json file of artists who's name which matches the keyword.
    •    Data is displayed as a UITableView.
    •    User selects any item from the list and a webkit page is loaded with detailed information about the artist.

I have attempted to implement the following:
    •    Programatic UI with UIKit
    •    MVVM architecture.
    •    RESTful call to MusicBrainz API


Frameworks/Libraries Used:
    •    UIKit
    •    SFSafariViewController
    •    Codable
    •    URLRequest
    •    URLSession
    •    JSONDecoder

ToDo:
    •    Add search button
    •    Add launch screen
    •    Maybe separate search bar and list view
